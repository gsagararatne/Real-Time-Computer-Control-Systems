# Real-Time-Computer-Control-Systems
A current course I'm taking at Ryerson University where I code C in LINUX. This is done through Oracle VM VirtualBox, and by remotely running code at the Electrical Engineering lab computers

Labs I've currently completed:

Lab 1: C review

Lab 2: Time and Clock

Lab 3: POSIX Threads and Concurrent Programming
